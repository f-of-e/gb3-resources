##	You will want to change the following to suit your setup:
##
SUNFLOWERROOT	= /f-of-e-tools/tools/sunflower

OSTYPE		= linux
MACHTYPE	= x86_64
#TARGET		= arm
#TARGET		= superH
TARGET		= riscv
TARGET-ARCH-FLAGS = -DM32
#TARGET-ARCH	= arm-none-eabi
#TARGET-ARCH	= sh-elf
TARGET-ARCH	= riscv32-elf
GMAKE		= /usr/bin/make
GNUSED		= /usr/bin/sed
GNUBISON	= /usr/bin/bison

#
#	On newer versions of macOS (High Sierra), you will need to install gcc
#	(as opposed to using the gcc alias on modern macOS that is
#	just an alias for clang). Because of various design choices
#	made in changes to gcc in recent years (mixing of C and C++
#	conventions for source file name extensions), you will need
#	to have a separate g++ binary that treats its input as either
#	C++ source or C++ object file (you won't be able to get away
#	with calling gcc with `-x c++ -lstdc++ -shared-libgcc`).
#
#	MacPorts no longer installs separate binaries for gcc versus
#	g++, so you will need to use homebrew (or some other alternative)
#	to get a version of gcc (e.g., gcc version 4.9) that lets you do.
#	this. Installing gcc-4.9 via homebrew is one solution that works.
#	You will then need to change TOOLCC and TOOLCXX below to gcc-4.9
#	and g++-4.9.
#
TOOLCC		= gcc
TOOLCXX		= g++
